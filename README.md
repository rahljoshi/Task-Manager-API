# Task-Manager-API
Created a RESTful API using Node.js, Express.js, and NPM packages. The API will allow users to perform CRUD operations 
(Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on tasks. The tasks should have a title, description, 
and a flag for completion status.  

Implement a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

- GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.

- GET /tasks/:id: Retrieve a single task by its ID.

- POST /tasks: Create a new task.

- PUT /tasks/:id: Update an existing task by its ID.

- DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task by its ID.
